    <h6>CECILY</h6>
    <p>I keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life. If I
    didn’t write them down, I should probably forget all about them.</p>

    <h6>MISS PRISM.</h6>
    <p>Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.</p>

    <h6>CECILY.</h6>
    <p>Yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and
    couldn’t possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible
    for nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.</p>

    <h6>MISS PRISM.</h6>
    <p>Do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one
    myself in earlier days.</p>

    <h6>CECILY.</h6>
    <p>Did you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it
    did not end happily? I don’t like novels that end happily. They depress
    me so much.</p>

    <h6>MISS PRISM.</h6>
    <p>The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction
    means.</p>

    <h6>CECILY.</h6>
    <p>I suppose so. But it seems very unfair. And was your novel ever
    published?</p>

    <h6>MISS PRISM.</h6>
    <p>Alas! no. The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned. [Cecily starts.]
    I use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid. To your work, child,
    these speculations are profitless.</p>

    <h6>CECILY.</h6>
    <p>[Smiling.] But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.</p>

    <h6>MISS PRISM.</h6>
    <p>[Rising and advancing.] Dr. Chasuble! This is indeed a pleasure.</p>

    <p>[Enter Canon Chasuble.]</p>

    <h6>CHASUBLE.</h6>
    <p>And how are we this morning? Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well?</p>

    <h6>CECILY.</h6>
    <p>Miss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache. I think it
    would do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the Park,
    Dr. Chasuble.</p>

    <h6>MISS PRISM.</h6>
    <p>Cecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.</p>

    <h6>CECILY.</h6>
    <p>No, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively that you had
    a headache. Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about my German
    lesson, when the Rector came in.</p>

    <h6>CHASUBLE.</h6>
    <p>I hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.</p>

    <h6>CECILY.</h6>
    <p>Oh, I am afraid I am.</p>

    <h6>CHASUBLE.</h6>
    <p>That is strange. Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism’s pupil, I
    would hang upon her lips. [Miss Prism glares.] I spoke
    metaphorically.—My metaphor was drawn from bees. Ahem! Mr. Worthing, I
    suppose, has not returned from town yet?</p>

    <h6>MISS PRISM.</h6>
    <p>We do not expect him till Monday afternoon.</p>
